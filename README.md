Hello! I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). My research focuses on neuromorphic vision perception and small object detection, aiming to advance computational models that mimic human-like visual perception systems.

## Research Interests

- **Neuromorphic Vision Perception:** Exploring bio-inspired algorithms and models for visual processing.
- **Small Object Detection:** Developing robust techniques for detecting and analyzing small-scale objects in complex environments.
